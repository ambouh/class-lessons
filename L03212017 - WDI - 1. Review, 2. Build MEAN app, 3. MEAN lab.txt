Learning Objectives

- Identify how different components of a MEAN app work together
- Build a simple MEAN app with data persistence, and dynamic views
- Provide an example of a MEAN app
--------------------------
I. Review

WHEN ENCOUNTERING INSTRUCTIONAL PROBLEMS
- check syntax
- google each line of error and figure out what's wrong 
- follow the message after NPM ERR!!...

SOLVING ISSUES
- 

procfile: a text file that explicitly defines the commands that Heroku should run while starting your app.

----------------------------
READ THE CODE WALKTHROUGH FOR THE REVIEW
RE-READ DEPLOYMENT FOR MEAN STACK ONTO 
----------------------------
- I WANT TO DO THAT BUT I WANT TO WORK ON MY PORTFOLIO
- BUT I WANT TO DO MY MOM'S WEB DESIGN
SO I'LL WORK ON CODE WALKTHROUGH
----------------------------
Reading Code walkthrough on the mean stack lead me to >> 
mean stack tutorial which lead me to >> 
REST (no too important but good to know) 
-----------------------------
REST (Representation State Transfer): web based architecture that uses HTTP protocol for data communication.
- a resource is accessed by (a form, webpage request -- a common interface) using HTTP methods

HOW IT WORKS
1. REST server provides access to resource (JSON objects)
2. REST client access resource and put it on their website
3. each resource have URI, GLOBAL ID
4. resource are pics, file, data represented by Text, JSON, XML represent with ID
5. plenty of libraries available to understand, parse and mod JSON data.

ex. JSON
{ "id": 1,
  "name": "manesh",
  "profession": "teacher"
}

HTTP METHODS 
(CRUD - Create uses PUT, Retrieve uses GET, Update uses POST/PATCH, delete uses DELETE)
- Get - provides read-only access to a resource
	- clarifies request: "get"
	- stateless HTTP request: "lchost:8080/rest/UsersServices/users
	- [this gets list of users]
- Put - used to create a new resource
	- clarifies request: "put"
	- stateless HTTP request: "lchost:8080/rest/UsersServices/users/2
	- [this inserts a users with id 2]
- Delete - used to remove an existing resource
	- clarifies request: "delete"
	- stateless HTTP request: "lchost:8080/rest/UsersServices/users/1
	- [this delete a users with id 1]
- Post - used to update an existing resource
	- clarifies request: "post"
	- stateless HTTP request: "lchost:8080/rest/UsersServices/users/2
	- [this update a users with id 2]
- options - used to get the supported operations on a resource (I guess if there is anything more custom you'd like to do with a resource you'll go about it through options)

MEAN STACK

To Run a simple server
http-server [path] [option]
---------------------------------

I finished the MEAN STACK tutorials & I learned to:
- write routes
- make an app in angularJs
- use expressJs workflow
- run app on my local server
--------------------------------
MEAN STACK [PRO VERSION]

I'm stuck on the cURL command and I want to move on or figure another way to  do it...

HOW TO SOLVE IT?
- check syntax, spelling for all your work
- List all the possible problems and the solutions as seen in StackOverflow
- How to test routes besides cURL


I'm so fustrated because running is so much beter than this...
Finding the problem with your code is the toughest thing to do with this code.
- Why routes don't works?
---------------------------------
BUILDING A MEAN APP

Mongoose is an ODM:
1. used to represent data in models (javascript backend)
2. simplifies actions on data or documents

AngularJs is a framework:
1. renders data
2. give impression of multiple page views on single page page siteg
3. extensible and works well with other library

MAKING API ROUTES
When wanting the front-end to be able to sync with back-end 
in order to provide data throughout our app. How IS it done?
1. build our own API
2. set up routes on back-end that serve back json when ajax request comes in
3. make ajax requests(request data from front-end) to our API

* namespace your back-end routes under API to avoid confusion with routes serving
HTML, and routes serving back our JSON data

* give a response for 'delete' request so client know deletion was successful

* JSON object is return from 'put' request with new candidate's info


WHAT JS SCRIPT MAKES AN APP RUN?
1. server looks for package.json
2. from there, server knows the first script to be read
3. this script:
 - initializes, sets up, and run the app. 
 - it also connects to the port that will listen for updates and requests
 - it also connects to db 
   or connects to another a script that connects to db

::::::::::::
MEAN STACK:

How they get stuff back in the ng-submit is how we would work it to send this info to email...
1. look at how info is being filled then sent in meanstack
2. emulate
3. add sendgrid function and send...

FROM FRONT-END

1. make module
- it initializes the app
:::::::
angular
  .module("whenPresident", [
    "ui.router",
    "ngResource"
  ])

2. make a router
- it gives you the routes to open all your pages 
::::::
    .config([
    "$stateProvider",
    "$locationProvider",
    "$urlRouterProvider",
    Router
    ])
3. make a controller
    .controller("showCtrl", [
        "$state",
        "$stateParams",
        "Candidate",
        showController
    ])

I hate to be able 

I'm so cpnfused because I already did it...I think I got my data the problem becomes

-------------------------
BOSSABLE.COM EMAIL TUTORIAL

1. in form, give it a controller to put methods and data
- make sure it's in your controller

2. send data from client to server using $http, so add it to your controller dependency and function parameter in same order
- inside your submit function, write an $http.post
- write a url of choice
- write data
 data = ({ first: this.email, second: this.message})
3. create a route, using: app.route
Use your ExpressJS Route as an API to call your ExpressJS Controller
- var core = require('../crtl/core.server.controller');
- app.route('/contact').post(core.submit) -- make sure method and route match

4. switch to express server controller
- edit an export.submit which receives your data
- you can retrieve the data: use var data = req.body
- you can use sendgrid code to send email at that point
- res.json(data): respond with data

-------------------
SAVED CODE
-------------------
// using SendGrid's v3 Node.js Library
// https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs

  var helper = require('sendgrid').mail;
  var mailBody = req.body;
  var sentEmail = "email";
  var sentMessage = "message";

  console.log(mailBody);

  from_email = new helper.Email(sentEmail);
  to_email = new helper.Email("ambouh@terpmail.umd.edu");
  subject = "New email from " + sentEmail + " !";
  content = new helper.Content("text/plain", sentMessage);
  mail = new helper.Mail(from_email, subject, to_email, content);

  var sg = require('sendgrid')(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
  var request = sg.emptyRequest({
    method: 'POST',
    path: '/v3/mail/send',
    body: mail.toJSON()
  });

  sg.API(request, function(error, response) {
    console.log(response.statusCode);
    console.log(response.body);
    console.log(response.headers);
  })
----------------------
- require (server.controller): keeps the scope of that route
- link app.post to method; this has the data request
- in server.controller, open the data request by saying
export.method(req,...){
var data = req.body
}
::::::::
MY CASE
- passes info straight to router
- link data using '/send'
- access data using req.body
- console.log(req.body)
