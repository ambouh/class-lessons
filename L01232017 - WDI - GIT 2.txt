GIT 2: https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/git-branching

- make sure to always comment thing properly so to not impact your employment

Fork - allows you to make your own copy onto your gitHub

Clone - allows you to make your own copy locally

-------------------------
HOW WOULD EDIT A FILE AND EDIT FROM DIRECTORS
 - create a branch save your edits
 - go into your master, work on & save the commitee edit to it
 - when done with old text, merge it to branch

-------------------------
WHY BRANCH?
1. To allow experimentation
2. To allow work to proceed on dif. ends
3. To fix bugs
4. No overhead
------------------------
When Do You Merge?
1. when bugs are fixed

HOW TO MERGE?
*To merge a branch onto master you MUST be on master!!*
git merge blue
-----------------------
Branches
git branch: gives you all local brnach
git branch -r: gives you remote branch available
git brnach -a: gives you all (local, remote) branches
git brnach -d <branch>: deletes branches

Is the master branch different from any other branch?
- No, a repo always start with master though which is the default

*you must create a remote branch on the remote repo [github]*

*It's considered good practice to use traversal because you can change the variable instead of *

- Remote and Local branches are different and local branches can be pushed to any remote branches regardless of the similarity in names. However, it's best to keep
branches names together unless you're merging a branch.

Pull Request - it's like git my info to yours. But ask for the request on your page.
