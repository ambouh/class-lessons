- my mom hurt me when she keeps mentioning me as a loser. I'm not one so I won't listen to it. My result will show that.

- I will call the school to verify. If 4 credits is in fact full time.

- I still don't know what I'll do w/o a mac to use.

- I feel this void, a lack of love when she talks about me like that I don't know my identity.

- This is me enduring the mistake I've been doing. I'd say she's taking it pretty well for the fact that I was kicked out of school and had to restart my life she has a heck of a belief in me.

- It's not about me. She's hurt and I'll show her that I'm fighting hard to make this happen. 

- I want to read 3% man

- I want to read the bible

- I want to check how much is left to my name
