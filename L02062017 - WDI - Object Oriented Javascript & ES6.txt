2/6/2017 - Object Oriented Javascript & ES6

LEARNING OBJECTIVES [OOJS]
- Explain the importance of OOJS
- Describe the role of ES2015 Classes and how they work
- Use the new keyword to create objects with - shared properties
- Create a class that inherits from another using the extends and super keywords
--------------------------
object - encapsulates related data and behavior in an organized structure


OOP helps us to achieve the following
- Abstraction: determining essential features
- Encapsulation: Containing and protecting methods and properties
- Modularity: Breaking down a program into smaller sub-programs

---------------------------
"new" & "this"

1. new- creates an empty object
2. this- generates a context, "this" new object
3. return the object
-----------------------------
Commas?
- no commas needed to seperate class methods [only {braces} are needed]
-----------------------------
What are the benefits to using an OOP approach to programming?
- 
What is a class? What is new? How are they related?
What does it mean to use "inheritance" when working with classes?
How do we indicate that one class inherits from another?
What does super mean?
