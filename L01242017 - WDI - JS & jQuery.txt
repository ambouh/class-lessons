- Describe math operators in JS
- Define type coercion

- Differentiate between true & false && truthy & falsey
- Write an if, else if, and else statement in JS
- Describe why control flow is utilized in computer programming
- Write a for loop and while loop in JS and differentiate between them

------------------------
JS - handles all interactive pieces

Why learn js?
- easy to learn
- ajax refresh without reloading
- gives access to alot of frameworks
------------------------
5 main primitives in JS
- numbers: stores numeric values
- Strings: represents text '' or " "
- Booleans: distinguishs between true and false
- Undefined: instantiated vars without value are undefined 
- Null: explicitly defined as undefined 

*values are stored in variables*
-----------------------
Operations
Basic operators: +, -, *, /
modules: (%) returns remainder
-----------------------
Concatenation - adds string together
-----------------------
Escape Sequences
\n: newline
-----------------------
String Methods
String.search("[Enter string]");
-----------------------
arrays: ordered collection of related data types
-----------------------
Comparisions operators

- compare the type(differentiates the type): "==="
- type-coercion(changes the type be same): "=="
- && : and
- || : or
- !  : not
-----------------------
LOOPS
* for (var i = 0; i <array.length; i++)
* for (i in array)
* while ( i < 10) { i++} 

while loop is used when amount is unknown
for loop is used when you know the amount
-----------------------
Getting User Input & Conditionals

.prompt();

jquery-dom
https://css-tricks.com/dom/

Is the html the same as the dom?
- html is static it will always look the same.
- but if we use JS to change an html, than it will change the DOM

DOM is visualized as a tree
-----------------------------
JQuery Basics
https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/jquery-dom

- load jQuery library to get access
- put your code in document ready syntax!!!!
$(document).ready(function(){
  console.log("hello world")
})
------------------------------

*Can't mix jquery function and vanilla function and then come back to jquery at that point it's not jquery anymore!*
