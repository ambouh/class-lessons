-----------------------------
AJAX and API's
- explain difference b/t async and sync execution
- explain why sync program aren't conducive to front-end
- Use jQuery $.ajax() method to make GET request
- Use jQuery 'promise-like' methods to handle AJAX resp.
- Render new HTML content using data loaded from AJAX request
- Perform POST, PUT and DELETE requests to an API to modify data

API - (Application Program Interface)
- refers to web URLs that can be accessed for raw data
- a service that provides raw data for public use.

JSON - (JS Object Notation)
- it's made of strings
- although, it looks like a JS object it needs to be parsed to be used like a JS object
- just an object
- just a key-value pair

XML
- the grandaddy of serialized data format (Based on HTML)
- JSON is more favorable than XML due to its readability

Promise - may or may not execute
Callback - will always execute
