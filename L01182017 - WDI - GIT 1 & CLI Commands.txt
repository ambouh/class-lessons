I used to be an intern and a student at school.
I work retail as a sales associate at Adidas, which I didn't totally love b/c it wasn't intriguing, I wasn't using my thinking skills.
As far as health, I'm in and out of the gym. I'm proactive about it when I care and then once I'm into it if things get hectic in my life and I tend to slowly stopped going.
My passion is in coding, art and building cool things that work.
