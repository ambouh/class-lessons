3/6/2017 - Angular Intro, Controllers, and Directives
-------------------------------
OBJECTIVE
- Benefits of using front-end frameworks
- Explain directives, modules, and ctrl in AngJs
- Render and bind ctrl data in the view
- Explain directive and how to use them
- Use ng-repeat, ng-hide, ng-show, ng-model, ng-click
-------------------------------

DIRECTIVES 
are markers on a DOM element (tags and attributes) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element

TWO-WAY DATA BINDING
- variable update on every change
- any property attached to the "vm" in the view, is also available in controller
